Place the new logo image file (provided in the conversation) into this folder with the filename `logo-m2.png`.

Recommended:
- Filename: `logo-m2.png` (or `logo-m2.svg`)
- Recommended size: 160x160px (the header will scale it down). For best results provide a square image with transparent background (PNG or SVG).

How to apply:
1. Save the attached logo image from the chat as `logo-m2.png`.
2. Put the file in the `public/` folder of the frontend project (this folder).
3. The header component has been updated to load `/logo-m2.png` automatically. No further code changes are required.

If you'd like, upload the image file here and I can add it to the repository for you.
